# 🎵 Audio Feature Extractor

A simple and extensible Python code for extracting audio features such as **MFCCs, LFCCs, and spectral shape descriptors**.  
Built on top of [librosa](https://librosa.org/), this project is useful for **speech processing, music analysis, and audio-based machine learning** tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- Extract **MFCCs** (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)  
- Extract **LFCCs** (Linear-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) with custom linear filter banks  
- Extract **Spectral Shape Descriptors** (centroid, spread, flux, ZCR, RMS, etc.)  
- Easy-to-use class interface  
- Returns features as **numpy array** for downstream ML workflows
